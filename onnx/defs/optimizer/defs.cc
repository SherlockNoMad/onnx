    Compute one iteration of Adam, a stochastic gradient based optimization
    algorithm. This operator can conduct the optimization of multiple tensor variables.

    Let's define the behavior of this operator. As you can imagine, ADAGRAD requires
    some parameters:
     
     - The initial learning-rate "R".
     - The update count "T". That is, the number of training iterations conducted.
     - A L2-norm regularization coefficient "lambda".
     - A small constant "epsilon" to avoid dividing-by-zero. 
     - Two coefficients, alpha and beta. 

    At each Adam iteration, the optimized tensors are moved along a direction
    computed based on their exponentially-averaged historical gradient and
    exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient. Assume that only a single
    tensor "X" is being optimized. We need
    
     - the value of "X", 
     - "X"'s gradient (denoted by "G"),
     - "X"'s exponentially-averaged historical gradient (denoted by "V"), and
     - "X"'s exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient (denoted by "H").

    Consequently, this operator's input tensor list is ["R," "T," "X," "G," "V," "H"].
    Other parameters are given as attributes because they are usually constants.
    Moreover, the corresponding output tensors are 
    
     - the new value of "X" (called "X_new"),
     - the new exponentially-averaged historical gradient (denoted by "V_new"), and
     - the new exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient (denoted by "H_new").

    Those outputs are computed following the pseudo code below.

    Let "+", "-", "*", and "/" are all element-wise arithmetic operations with
    numpy-style broadcasting support. The pseudo code to compute those outputs is:

      // Add gradient of 0.5 * lambda * ||X||_2^2, where ||X||_2 is the 2-norm.
      G_regularized = lambda * X + G;

      // Update exponentially-averaged historical gradient.
      V_new = alpha * V + (1 - alpha) * G_regularized;

      // Update exponentially-averaged historical squared gradient.
      H_new = beta * H + (1 - beta) * G_regularized * G_regularized;

      // The gradient will be element-wisely divided by the following tensor.
      H_sqrt = Sqrt(H_new) + epsilon;

      // Compute learning-rate. Note that "alpha^T"/"beta^T" is alpha's/beta's T-th power.
      R_adjusted = R * Sqrt(1 - beta^T) / (1 - alpha^T);

      // Compute new value of "X."
      X_new = X - R_adjusted * V_new / H_sqrt

    If there are multiple inputs to be optimized, the pseudo code will be applied
    independently to each of them.
